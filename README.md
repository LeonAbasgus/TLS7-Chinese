## 🔍 What is TLS7?

**TLS7** stands for **Text Layered Structure – 7 Levels**. It is an open, semantic format for presenting complex literary or sacred texts in a way that is:

- **Modular** – organized in discrete, aligned layers
- **Human-readable** – readable and meaningful across cultures
- **Machine-readable** – easily parsed by NLP pipelines

Originally developed for Biblical Hebrew, TLS7 is now adapted for Classical Chinese.

## 🧱 The Seven Layers

Each passage is represented in the following layers:

1. **Original Text** – e.g., Classical Chinese
2. **Phonetic Transliteration** – e.g., Pinyin
3. **Translation** – in Russian and English
4. **Morphological Analysis** – lemma, POS, glosses
5. **Syntax Structure** – simplified JSON
6. **Historical/Cultural Commentary** – context and ideological usage
7. **UI Metadata** – tooltips, audio, stroke-order, interactivity
